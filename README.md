# Package Install Script

This is a script that updates your system and installs packages for you.

Only compatible with Debian and Ubuntu based systems. DO NOT use this with
redhat, Fedora, OpenSUSE, any Arch based systems, etc.

To run the script, run this command:

./PackageInstallScript.sh

If that does not work, you may need to set permissions, in that case run:

chmod +x PackageInstallScript.sh

If you get errors in the script, you may be running a non Debian/Ubuntu
based system.
